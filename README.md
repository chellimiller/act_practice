# ACT Practice Site

This is a project that I'm designing for my little brother. I may not finish in time for it to be helpful to him, but I figure it's worth a shot.

## Planning

I plan to do this project in several stages. Initially, I want to make a simple page that populates the form with the question and possible answers. For now, I'm only focusing on the client-side code.

Eventually, I would like to pull the possible questions from a MongoDB or MySQL database. This will likely be done with a NodeJS backend.
